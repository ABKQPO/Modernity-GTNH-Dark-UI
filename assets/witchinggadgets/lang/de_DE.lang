witchinggadgets_research_page.WALLMIRROR.1=§7Further delving into the magic of the mirrors has lead you to the discovery of a safe haven within the void between worlds.<BR>While this location is brimming with magic, otherwise it appears to be void of anything. It has no visible layer of flooring, yet somehow you can stand there.<BR>This space seems to be an excellent way of traveling. Since it is vast and empty as well, it should be easy to store any of your belongings in this void-between-worlds

The dimension accessed through it is the same from any mirror, but portals out of it are only created where it is entered. This means that you can only leave where another Mirror has been placed in the Overworld.<BR><BR>§lNavigation:§r<BR>An invisible floor will spawn in a 5x5 below you wherever you walk. These blocks can be replaced with normal blocks by right-clicking them, allowing you to build there. Jump to ascend, the floor will follow you. Holding the sneak key will make you descend.

Simply applying a redstone signal to this new type of stone will make it §onon-corporeal§r, allowing you to pass through it.<BR>This also affects any other Etheral Wall connected to the powered block.<BR>Furthermore, you can disguise this stone to the appearance of most common blocks. Simply click it with a block in hand it and this one will take its texture. Sneak and click it with an empty hand to remove the disguise.

Simply click it with a block in hand it and this one will take its texture. Sneak and click it with an empty hand to remove the disguise. (It will only accept the texture of normally rendered blocks. Vanilla transparency works, Thaumcraft's Amber doesn't because it's coloured transparency, directional textures like wooden logs and quartz pillars are not fully supported)

Those skilled in the magical arts don't want to waste their time on the tedious digging of these stones and have therefore created an automated way.<BR>This machine will create cobblestone, break it and place it either on the ground or into a connected inventory. Work will be halted if the inventory is full or a redstone signal is applied. You can use a wand to rotate it.

So instead you have decided to channel your knowledge of such time dilating arts into another form of Arcane Stone.<BR>The Ageing Stone will accelerate the ageing of most common creatures, making lambs, calves and piglets grow up much faster when exposed to it's magical energies.<BR>The Ageing Stone will apply this effect to all creatures in a 7x7x5 area centered around itself, with more blocks increasing the effect.

witchinggadgets_research_page.SPINNINGWHEEL.1=§7While many great Wizards neglect the practice of spinning and weaving, many of them do that by underestimating its true power. A number of magical artifacts are the product of clothwork, including every thaumaturge's robes. Some witches will testify that spellcrafting in itself even has a lot in common with weaving, requiring careful handling of the respective components; be it raw magic in its aspects or thread.
witchinggadgets_research_page.SPINNINGWHEEL.2=§7§lCrafting§r<LINE>Every practitioners start into the field should be made by creating their very own §lSpinning Wheel§r. It will be used if in aquiring yarn, be it mundane, of exquisite material or some enhanced with magic. This yarn will then later be used to weave the fabric from which to craft various garments or magic artifacts. See the §lLoom§r for further details.

witchinggadgets_research_page.LOOM.1=§7To process further the process the yarn and thread gained by spinning, the wizard will have to craft himself a magic loom on which to weave his magic fabric. This  construct will not only interweave the threads, it will also infuse them with various §lAspects§r, granting them magical properties. To infuse the fabric with aspects, simply make sure a §lWarded Jar§r containing some is in the vicinity<BR>To start the weaving after setting the recipe, simply tap the loom with your wand.

witchinggadgets_research_text.ARCANEAUTOCRAFTER=§7[WG] Au-Thaum-nomous Crafting!
witchinggadgets_research_page.ARCANEAUTOCRAFTER.1=§7Those mages who discovered the secrets of immortality (you recognize them by the long, white beard) have all the time in the world. But what about your average thaumaturge? In order to save yourself some time, why not let someone else do the tedious and repetitive crafting operations? Of course, no one would entrust a golem with something as powerful as a wand, but this semi-sentient wooden table will do nicely.
witchinggadgets_research_page.ARCANEAUTOCRAFTER.2=§7Simply set your preferred recipe (normal recipe or arcane crafting), provide it with the materials and, if needed, a charged wand, and wait for it to do your bidding. Note however, that the knowledge of crafting is limited to that of the player who put down the block.

witchinggadgets_research_page.CALCULATOR.1=§7As a skilled thaumaturge, close to achieving eldritch knowledge, you are an expert on chaos. ...It might also stem from your lack of mathematical knowledge. But who would bother themselves with sciences of the common man when there are enchantments that do it for you?<BR>The Arcane Abacus will take some of the mundane mathematics off your hands. Use it on a Node that contains compound aspects and it will calculate it to primal values. Use it on an Infusion Matrix to check the stability value and point out misplaced stabilizers.
witchinggadgets_research_page.CALCULATOR.2=§7§oThe highest infusion instability known to man *cough*Thaumic Tinkerer*cough* is 15. Stabilizing your altar beyond that is pointless.

witchinggadgets_research_page.BAGOFTRICKS.1=§7Further advancements in magical weaving have led you to the discovery of the §lCloth of Spacious Folds§r. A most interesting weave, which seems to contain more room in its folds than visible from the outside. Crafting a bag from this provides you with space for storage to easily carry on your person.<BR>The fabric also turns out to be very protective of its contents, and it will harm any but the owner, should they try to access the bag. §oThis behaviour can be toggled by the owner by sneak+rightlick.§r

witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK.1=§7After noticing the excellent "swishing"-properties of Enchanted Fabric, you have quickly drawn out some schematics to create a cloak from it. While this standard cloak lacks any special abilities, its magical fabric should provide an excellent base for more advanced spellwoven mantles.<BR>§oTo be equipped in the Traveller's Gear inventory, the default keybinding is 'Numpad 7'. Certain abilities of the advanced cloaks can be activated. This is done via the 'Active Abilities'-menu of Traveller's Gear. The default keybinding is 'R'.§r

witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAK_RAVEN=§7Mantle of the Raven
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAK_RAVEN=§7[WG] CA-CAW!
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_RAVEN.1=§7On your travels throughout the Twilight Forest, you have come across the most fascinating Forest Raven. This remarkable bird displays high agility and maneuverability in the air, a feat to be envious of.<BR>Instead of being envious you could also just adorne your cloak with their feathers and imbue it with magical power...<BR>While wearing this cloak, your speed while flying increases noticeably. And should you not be flying, the cloak will allow you to glide instead. Gliding can be disabled in the ActiveAbility menu.
# OLD witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_RAVEN.1=§7On your travels throughout the Twilight Forest, you have come across the most fascinating Forest Raven. This remarkable bird appears to always find back to his nesting place, even within the dense and dark forest it calls home.<BR>Plucking a feather from it, you have discovered that it, albeit in small scale, inherits this ability. Now you just have to amplify this ability with your thaumic capabilities and infuse your garment with it. The result is the §lMantle of the Raven§r which allows you to set and return to your nesting place at the cost of a raven's feather. You may substitute three chicken feathers.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAK_SPECTRAL=§7Spectral Mantle
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAK_SPECTRAL=§7[WG] Now you see me...
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_SPECTRAL.1=§7The plane of the spectral beings is a mystery to most common men. Fortunately, you are not most men. After infusing a cloak with eldritch and spectral energies it will grant you the ability to 'shift' yourself to that plane. While walking among it, you are invisble to those that walk along the normal plane. Enemies will not see or target you unless they are creatures of eldritch, posses exemptual powers or are wearing Goggles of Revealing.<BR>This ability comes at the cost of being unable to interact with the physical world. You cannot attack, use items, break or activate blocks. Furthermore it will drain 1 aer vis from you inventory every 5 seconds.
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_SPECTRAL.2=§7§oDisclaimer: Creatures that can still see you include: Eldritch Guardians, Eldritch Wardens, Eldritch Golems, Cultist Praetors, as well as boss mobs like the Wither or the Enderdragon. Any other user of this cloak will also be able to see you.§r
#Creating a cloak that is invisible is an easy task for a thaumaturge, but applying the effect to it's wearer was the hard task. After tedious research however, you have created the §lCloak of Invisibility§r, a garment that renders you invisible to the naked eye. The cloak itself lost a bit of his magic in the process, now only turning mostly transparent, leaving a slight shimmer. Other armor pieces or items that you are holding in your hand are not affected.

witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAK_WOLF=§7Cloak of the Wolf
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAK_WOLF=§7[WG] What a big mouth you have!
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_WOLF.1=§7The old tales tell of the beserkers, unrelenting warriors, imbued by ancient magic and wrapped in the fur of a wolf.<BR>Your studies have revealed magical procedures like these and for reasons of style and nostalgia you decided they were best integrated into a cloak of wolf fur. Should you sustain damage while wearing it, you gain additional attack damage and speed, akin to the fearless warriors of old.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.ENDERBAG=§7Enderlinked Bag
witchinggadgets_research_text.ENDERBAG=§7[WG] Everywhere and nowhere at once!

#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAKKAMA=§7Kama
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAKKAMA=§7[WG] It's not a kilt!
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAKKAMA.1=§7Cloaks and their advanced deriatives have proven to be both fashionable and useful, but also quite big and unwieldly. Shortening them and attaching them to a belt transforms them into a Kama, a sort of half-skirt covering the back of the legs. They still perform the same tasks, they are just located at a different part of your body now.<BR>§l§4WARNING: Due to an unknown error, shift clicking the result out of the crafting table will result in a loss of NBT-data. In order to preserve enchantments on the cloak, its colouration and items stored inside it, make sure to take the Kama out of the slot with a normal click.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.RUNICCLOAK=§7Runic Cloaks
witchinggadgets_research_text.RUNICCLOAK=§7[WG] The best of both worlds
witchinggadgets_research_page.RUNICCLOAK.1=§7While being protected by Runic Armor is vital, you really enjoy the abilities granted by your magical cloaks. Why not have both?<BR>By affixing the charms of the runic chestpiece to any of the magical cloaks, you can enjoy the benefits of both.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.ROSEVINE=§7Rose Vines
witchinggadgets_research_text.ROSEVINE=§7[WG] Pointy!
witchinggadgets_research_page.ROSEVINE.1=§7These thorny plants are the first results of a Thaumaturge delving into Herbology. While not very decorative, their sharp thorns and quick growth makes them ideal for setting up a natural security perimeter for any §mcastle§r base with §ma sleeping beauty§r treasure inside to safeguard. Spreading vines can be harvested with Shears.

witchinggadgets_research_page.PURECINNABAR.1=§7Native clusters are rare concentrations of metals in its purest form.

witchinggadgets_research_text.GEMCUTTING=§7[WG] Everything is crystal clear!
witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.1=§7Gemcutting is one of the oldest yet most refined forms of giving magic a physical form. If a gem is infused with magic, it is no longer dependant on the user. Any mortal can use the power stored inside a cut gem, making this a viable option of giving power to those not skilled in the thaumaturgic arts.<BR>Gems vary in their function based on their cut and the magical essence infused into them.
witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.2=§7§lNatural Affinities§r<BR>Some stones have inheirent natural affinities for certain aspects, which applies a natural strengthening to their effect. If the affinity matches the infused aspect, the gem will be enchanted with "Brilliance", the level depending on the amount of essences used in the creation.<BR>§lNatural Aversions§r<BR>Similarly, some gems have natural aversions to certain aspect, and infusing them with them will make the resulting gem brittle, weakening it's effect and adding a chance for reuseable gems to break.<BR> Hold shift while looking at a gem to see its affinites and aversions.

It allows the basic storage of aspected vis, but its energy can only be released in by crushing it, leaving Gemstone Dust.
#effects
witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.3=§7§lPoint Cut§r<LINE>The point cut is the most basic form you can give to your infused gem. While it can store thaumic energies, the only way to release this energy is by crushign the gem, leaving behind some gemstone dust. The effects varying by aspect, are as follows:<BR>§e§lAer: §r§0You aquire a short-term, high powered jumpboost.<BR>§2§lTerra: §r§0Grants you knockback resistance.<BR>§c§lIgnis: §r§0Iluminates an area around you with temporary glimmers of light.

witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.5=§7§lOval Cut§r<LINE>The oval cut is an advanced form of the infused gems. With the increase in facettes, it can store much more energy and release it in smaller, concentrated bursts. The effects are quite different from those of the point cut gems and these can be recharged with vis of a matching aspect.<BR>Due to its complexety, using a base gem without a natural affinity for the aspect makes the resulting gem very brittle, and in turn, the essentia required to create a brilliant gem has increased.
witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.6=§7§e§lAer: §r§0The energies propell you through their air. Consumes 1 charge per use.<BR>§2§lTerra: §r§0Upon using it on a block, it checks connected blocks for ores. Consumes 1 charge per use.<BR>§c§lIgnis: §r§0Starts a fire at the targeted block.
