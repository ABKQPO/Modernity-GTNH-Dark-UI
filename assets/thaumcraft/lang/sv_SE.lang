tc.research_name.RESEARCH=§7Research
tc.research_text.RESEARCH=§7How you discover things
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.1=§7Before you can build most thaumaturgical items and blocks, you first need to discover how to do so. There are several steps in this process:<BR>(1) Exploring the world and examining blocks, items and creatures with a §5Thaumometer§0<BR><BR>(2) Taking the research points you gathered from the first step and expanding your aspect knowledge with the §5Research Table§0<BR><BR>(3) Using the aspects you know and discovering practical knowledge and recipes with the §5Research Table§0.<LINE>
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.2=§7§l      §n(1) Exploration§r<BR><BR>You cannot perform research without research points, and the best way to gain research points is by exploration and examining objects in the world.<BR>The first thing you will need to do is construct a §5Thaumometer§0 (see next page). By pointing the §5Thaumometer§0 at objects or creatures and holding the right mouse button you will start examining them. The process does not take long, but your movement speed is reduced while it is occurring.<BR>Once complete the §5Thaumometer§0 will display what aspects the object contains. In the bottom right of the screen you will also see a summary of the aspects and research points
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.3=§7you discovered.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research1.png:0:0:255:208:.5</IMG>You will initially not be able to examine all objects since you have not discovered their component aspects. For example, a object containing the Lux aspect can only be examined if you have previously discovered the Lux aspect, or know
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.4=§7the two aspects that combine to create it.<BR>The very first time you discover an aspect by examining something you gain two more research points than you would have normally.<BR>Objects and creatures can usually only ever be examined once.<BR>Occasionally examining something will reveal additional clues and insights into thaumoturgical research, unlocking subjects that you can research further.<BR>Research discovered in this fashion will have amber icons.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.5=§7§l   §n(2) Combining Aspects§r<BR><BR>Once you have gathered some research points you can attempt to combine them into compound aspects within a research table.<BR>To craft a research table simply place two §5tables§0 next to each other and click on them with a set of Scribing Tools. The recipe for tables is listed under the §5Artiface§0 research category.<BR>If you open the research tables inventory, you will see an interface as pictured on the right.<BR>The scribing tools you used to craft the table will be located in slot §l1§r.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.6=§7<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research2.png:0:0:128:83:1</IMG>You should see all the primal aspects (and possibly some compound aspects) listed in the area marked §l3§r with varying amounts attached to them. When you enter a world for the first time, every player is assigned a small pool of primal aspects to get them started.<BR>If you had done some exploring with
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.7=§7the thaumometer beforehand then you might have a significant number of primal and compound aspects listed here.<BR>You can now start combining aspects into more complex compound aspects but simply clicking on those you wish to combine or dragging it to the runed circles in area §l4§r. The selected aspects will appear in area §l4§r and when you have two selected pressing the purple button will attempt to combine them. If successful you should see what was gained in the bottom right and it should appear in area §l3§r.<BR>The component aspects are consumed even if the combination did not result in valid compound aspect.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.8=§7§l   §n(3) Primary Research§r<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research2.png:0:88:255:158:.5</IMG>You need to be carrying a set of scribing tools and paper for this step.<BR>If you open your Thaumonomicon you will see all the knowledge have and also all the knowledge that you are now able to persue.<BR>Flashing square or round icons represent primary researches.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.9=§7If you can read their title (instead of seeing strange runes) you are simply able to click on them. Paper and ink will be consumed from your inventory and you will gain a research note. You can now take this research note to the table to start researching it by placing it in slot §l2§r.<BR>Section §l5§r will now display a sheet of paper covered in hexagonal tiles with aspect icons around the outer edge. If you see question mark icons it means you do not know that aspect yet and you will need to learn it first.<LINE>
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.10=§7To complete your research you simply need to connect and activate all the aspects. You do this by dragging an aspect to a hex adjacent to it that is either composed of the target aspect, or can be combined with another aspect to form the target aspect.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research3.png:0:0:150:95:.75</IMG>Placing an aspect consumes one research point. If you make a mistake you can click on the aspect to remove it, but you will not regain the research point.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.11=§7You continue doing the until you have formed a pattern connecting all the starting aspects. The outer aspects need not be connected to all the others, they simply need to form a connected whole.<BR>Once this is done the research will complete and the research note will turn into a discovery.<LINE>NOTE: Placing and removing aspects from the hex grid consumes ink from your scribing tools. If it runs out you will not be able to proceed until you refill it.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.12=§7§l    §nSecondary Research§r<BR>Hexagonal icons indicate Secondary research. Much like primary research you just need to click on them. However instead of gaining a research note, you will simply learn the research directly. Secondary research does have an aspect cost you need to pay, but they do not require you to be carrying scribing tools or paper.

tc.research_name.KNOWFRAG=§7Knowledge Fragments
tc.research_text.KNOWFRAG=§7Fragments of lost lore
tc.research_page.KNOWFRAG.1=§7In your travels you might happen upon fragments of ancient and lost knowledge. On their own they are only worth a few research points when used, but if you gather enough of them together you might gain unique research that you can pursue. Usually the research they reveal cannot be gained through normal means.<BR>The fragments of knowledge can on occasion lead to a false theory, but this will be revealed when you attempt to research it. When this happens most of your knowledge fragments will be returned to you and it usually means you have exhausted all current avenues of research into lost knowledge.
#
tc.research_name.ASPECTS=§7Aspects of Magic
tc.research_text.ASPECTS=§7The building blocks of magic
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.1=§7Every item, object or creature is bound by varying mystical elements known as §5aspects§0. Aspects describe the object's makeup and bent towards the magical elements. A simple stone may possess the aspect of Saxum while more complex items like trees or even creatures can be made up of various different aspects in varying amounts. There are close to 50 known aspects with more being discovered all the time.<LINE>There are two main types of aspects: §5Primal§0 and §5Compound§0.
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.2=§7§lPrimal Aspects§r are the most basic types of aspects and there are only 6 of them: §6Aer§0 (air), §2Terra§0 (earth), §cIgnis§0 (fire), §3Aqua§0 (Water), §7Ordo§0 (order), §8Perditio§0 (entropy).<BR>These form the basic building blocks of all other aspects.<BR>§lCompound Aspects§r are built from two other aspects. The simplest compound aspects are made from two primal aspects, but it is possible to have incredibly complex compound aspects made from successive layers of simpler aspects.<BR>The simplest example of such a compound aspect, is the aspect of Victus (life), which is a combination of §2Terra§0 and §3Aqua§0.
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.3=§7To view what aspects an item possesses, simply hover your cursor over the item and press sneak (shift), and you will see what aspects that item has and what amounts of each. You will first need to study the item however, until then the aspects will remain unknown.<LINE>Aspects that have somehow been separated from their object and purified is known as §5Vis§0 and is very valuable: both as a crafting ingredient and as a subject for magical research.<BR>Vis is most often bound into wands, but it is also possible to store it as a magical liquid. Vis stored as a liquid is known as §5Essentia§0.
#
tc.research_name.NODES=§7Auras and Nodes
tc.research_text.NODES=§7Magic is everywhere
tc.research_page.NODES.1=§7The §5Aura§0 is a field of magical energy prevalent throughout the world. Its origin is unclear. Some believe it is the accumulated life force of living beings, while others believe it to merely be another type of energy seeping in from some other place. The last theory seems to be most likely, as the aura is often found surrounding a node of concentrated mystical energy known as an §5Aura Node§0.<BR>Each aura node has a base amount of magical energy it can contain and this energy is aligned to one or more aspects. It is usually aligned to §5Primal Aspects§0, but rarely a node may contain §5Compound Aspects§0.
tc.research_page.NODES.2=§7The aspects within an aura node can be tapped by a thaumaturge for his own purposes. The simplest way to do so is with the use of a wand.<BR>Energy that has been harvested in this manner is known as vis.<LINE>Aura nodes are hard to see with the naked eye, but faint glimmers of light often betray their presence. The §5Thaumometer§0 makes nodes slightly easier to find, as looking through its lens makes them clearly visible.<BR>§4Important:§0 Caution must be taken when draining a node. There is a small chance that when a specific type of aspect within a node is completely drained, it may
tc.research_page.NODES.3=§7disappear or harm the integrity of the node.<BR>It is possible for the node to disappear completely if all the aspects disappear.<LINE>Fortunately most nodes replenish their aspects over time and if properly maintained can provide a clever thaumaturge with all the vis he could want.

tc.research_page.ORE.2=§7These crystals have various elemental properties and have many uses in Thaumaturgy.<BR>There are six types of infused stone, one for each of the Primal Aspects.<BR><BR><IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research3.png:0:104:96:16:1</IMG><BR>They can be combined together to form crystal clusters. Crystal clusters have no special properties beyond adding a touch of class to any home. Breaking a crystal cluster causes it to shatter into its component crystals.

tc.research_page.PLANTS.2=§7§l     §nSilverwood Trees§r<BR><IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research4.png:0:128:128:128:.6</IMG><BR>These rare and magical trees are a wondrous sight. Their leaves shimmer with magical energy and their pale, soft wood is valued for its purifying properties.<BR>The trees magical nature is such that aura nodes often form within their hearts - this feature alone makes a silverwood sapling a prize beyond measure.
tc.research_page.PLANTS.3=§7§l        §nShimmerleaf§r<BR><IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research4.png:128:0:128:128:.6</IMG><BR>The strange, glowing flowers only grow in the shadow of Silverwood Trees.

tc.research_page.RESEARCHER1.1=§7You have become more efficient at performing research.<BR>Whenever you remove an aspect that you placed in a hex, there is a 25% chance that you will regain the research point.<BR>You are also able to see what aspects you need to combine to create an aspect you are hovering over.
#
tc.research_name.RESEARCHER2=§7Research Mastery
tc.research_text.RESEARCHER2=§7Power is Knowledge
tc.research_page.RESEARCHER2.1=§7You have become even more efficient at performing research.<BR>Whenever you remove an aspect that you placed in a hex, there is a 50% chance that you will regain the research point.<BR>Additionally there is a 10% chance that whenever you place an aspect that it will not cost any research points to do so.<BR>Lastly you are able to combine aspects in the research table by shift-clicking on the aspect you wish to create. If you have enough of the component aspects they will automatically combine to create the clicked aspect.
#
tc.research_name.RESEARCHDUPE=§7Research Duplication
tc.research_text.RESEARCHDUPE=§7Sharing is Caring
tc.research_page.RESEARCHDUPE.1=§7You have discovered a way to copy completed research note.<BR>When you complete research or place a completed research note in the research table you will see a star icon. Clicking this will create a copy of this research as long as you are carrying paper and ink and have enough aspects available.<BR>The more copies are created of that research, the more expensive copying it will become.
#
tc.research_name.DECONSTRUCTOR=§7Deconstruction table
tc.research_text.DECONSTRUCTOR=§7When taking a good look just isn't enough
tc.research_page.DECONSTRUCTOR.1=§7There comes a point in any thaumaturge's career where he is unable to progress with research due to his lack of knowledge. <BR>One possible recourse is the Deconstruction Table. The table allows you to break down objects into their simplest parts which you can examine. There are limits however - the table breaks compound aspects into their component aspects until only primal aspects remain. During this process much knowledge is lost and at best the thaumaturge can hope for is a single piece of primal knowledge.<BR>For example cobblestone (Saxum and
tc.research_page.DECONSTRUCTOR.2=§7§8Perditio§0) will be simplified into 2 §2Terra§0 and 1 §8Terra§0, only one of which will have a chance of being discovered.<BR>It is also fairly slow and the fewer aspects and object has, the lower the chance to discover something.

tc.research_name.BASICTHAUMATURGY=§7Basic Wandcraft
tc.research_text.BASICTHAUMATURGY=§7Your first tool
tc.research_page.BASICTHAUMATURGY.1=§7The casting wand is your most basic, but also your most important tool. It is what you use to craft objects, activate blocks like the crucible, and countless other tasks.<BR>The most basic wand stores a very limited amount of magical energy (called vis) that it uses to perform its tasks. The replenish the energy in a wand, you must right-click and hold to draw vis from an aura node.<BR>While holding a wand you will see a indicator on the top left of the screen that shows how much vis is stored within the wand.
tc.research_page.BASICTHAUMATURGY.2=§7Holding shift will display exact numbers held by the wand and any possible discounts you have to performing magical tasks.<BR>Wands are always constructed by the combination of a rod and two end-caps. As you progress with your studies, you are sure you will discover different materials that you can use to craft rods and caps to make powerful wands. Only the basic wand can be put together in a normal crafting table. All other wands require the §5Arcane Workbench§0 and will cost vis to construct.<BR>The basic wand is constructed from mundane wood and iron, both of which make poor materials for working magic.

tc.research_name.GRATE=§7Item Grate
tc.research_text.GRATE=§7Let the good things in
tc.research_page.GRATE.1=§7The item grate allows you to toggle it open or close it with your hand, or with a redstone signal.

tc.research_name.NODEPRESERVE=§7Node Preserver
tc.research_text.NODEPRESERVE=§7Saving some for later
tc.research_page.NODEPRESERVE=§7You now have better control over the amount of vis you draw from nodes. You will always leave at least one vis of each aspect in the node, unless you are sneaking.<BR>Be warned, this level of control is not possible when using wands crafted from normal wood and iron.
#
tc.research_name.THAUMOMETER=§7Thaumometer
tc.research_text.THAUMOMETER=§7Measuring Magic
tc.research_page.THAUMOMETER.1=§7This Thaumometer is one of the most useful and important tools in a thaumaturgists arsenal, second only to the wand.<BR>Firstly it allows you to scan objects, creatures or mystical phenomena and determine their magical make-up. You simply need to hold the right mouse button and wait.<BR>Secondly it makes discovering nodes easier, as they become clearly visible if viewed through the Thaumometer's lens - even through solid objects!

tc.research_name.GOGGLES=§7Goggles of Revealing
tc.research_text.GOGGLES=§7Seeing the Unseen
tc.research_page.GOGGLES.1=§7Building on the basic principles of the Thaumometer, you have begun refining its ability to detect magic into something more... revealing.<BR>This set of mystical lenses will make aura nodes much easier to find along with revealing all manner of hidden things.<BR>They form an important tool in any Thaumaturgist's arsenal.
#
tc.research_name.THAUMIUM=§7Magical Metallurgy
tc.research_text.THAUMIUM=§7Where metals meet magic
tc.research_page.THAUMIUM.1=§7Metals have proven to be quite easy to manipulate via thaumaturgical principles. Your first experiments have led to discovery of Thaumium.<BR>Thaumium is the result of infusing base metals with raw magical energy. The result is a metal harder than iron with the ability to accept enchantments beyond that which iron is normally capable of.<BR>A metal such as this has many applications in the crafting of more advanced thaumaturgical devices.<BR>It can also be used to craft tools, arms and armour in a crafting table using the normal recipes.

tc.research_name.NITOR=§7Nitor
tc.research_text.NITOR=§7Mystical Flame
tc.research_page.NITOR.1=§7This flame seems to be fuelled by magic itself. The number of uses for an everburning flame seems endless, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to produce much more light than heat, though it could prove to be a steady source of light and energy.<BR>Nitor can also be placed in the world to act as a magical light source.

tc.research_name.ALUMENTUM=§7Alumentum
tc.research_text.ALUMENTUM=§7Mystical Energy Source
tc.research_page.ALUMENTUM.1=§7This substance throbs with fiery energy and it is more than eager to release that energy at the slightest bump.

tc.research_name.CAP_thaumium=§7Thaumium Wand Caps
tc.research_text.CAP_thaumium=§7Magical wand caps
tc.research_page.CAP_thaumium.1=§7Thaumium is known for its ability to store and absorb magic, so using it to craft wand caps is a logical choice. It is very efficient at focusing vis of all types.<BR>Crafting these wand caps in an arcane worktable is not sufficient - they need to be infused with additional magical energy to make them usable.
#
tc.research_name.CAP_silver=§7Silver Wand Caps
tc.research_text.CAP_silver=§7Capping things off with a little less style
tc.research_page.CAP_silver.1=§7Silver has similar properties to gold when used as a wand cap, but it slightly more efficient at channeling the four elemental primals (fire, earth, air and water).<BR>Crafting these wand caps in an arcane worktable is not sufficient - they need to be infused with additional magical energy to make them usable.

tc.research_text.ARCTABLE=§7Crafting with magic
tc.research_page.ARCTABLE.1=§7To create an Arcane Worktable simply right-click with a wand on a table you have placed in the world. The Arcane Worktable serves the same purpose as a normal crafting table, with a few key exceptions.<BR>Apart from normal crafting recipes, it can also craft some of the items unique to Thaumaturgy. To do that you need to place a wand in the top-right slot. This will allow you to craft items that require vis by drawing the energy directly from the wand.<BR>The vis required to craft an item will be shown in the six circular symbols surrounding the crafting grid.
#
tc.research_name.RESTABLE=§7Research Table
tc.research_text.RESTABLE=§7To gather knowledge

tc.research_text.CRUCIBLE=§7Bubble and Boil
tc.research_page.CRUCIBLE.1=§7To craft the Crucible, you must simply use your wand on a cauldron placed in the world.<BR>The crucible is an important tool for any thaumaturge. It allows him to render physical objects into their component Essentia and recombine it again as he wishes.<BR>The crucible needs to be placed over a source of constant heat and filled with water. Once the water starts boiling you simply throw any items you wish into the crucible and they will be broken down into their component Essentia.<BR>If you know the proper formula and the mix of essentia within the
tc.research_page.CRUCIBLE.2=§7crucible is correct, you can then drop a special item into the crucible known as a Catalyst. The catalyst draws the essentia into itself and transforms into a whole new item that the crucible then ejects.<BR>Any leftover Essentia remains within the crucible for further use, but it is not a good idea to leave essentia within a crucible for too long.<BR>Crafting also uses some of the water within the crucible and you will eventually need to refill it.<BR>Essentia within the crucible is constantly degrading. Compound essentia degrades into one of its component aspects, and Primal essentia simply evaporates.
tc.research_page.CRUCIBLE.3=§7Beyond the waste of resources, evaporating and degrading essentia can cause many strange side-effects.<BR>You can empty a crucible by right-clicking on it with a wand. All the essentia is dumped into the atmosphere... not something you would want to do too often.

tc.research_text.ENCHFABRIC=§7Silky and Stylish
tc.research_page.ENCHFABRIC.1=§7By combining spider silk and wool and infusing it with primal vis, you have created a silky length of magical cloth that would have numerous uses.<BR>You have also discovered patterns to create cloth robes from the magical fabric. These robes have similar protective properties to leather armor, but they are much more durable than mundane materials could ever be.<BR>They also hold mystical enchantments very well and can hold powerful magic much better than even expensive armor.
tc.research_page.ENCHFABRIC.2=§7The various pieces of this outfit grant a small discount to the amount of vis drained from casting wands when you use them.<BR>You can dye the armor like you would leather armor.

tc.research_page.ELEMENTALSHOVEL.2=§7If shift is held while using this tool all its special properties are suspended and it functions like a normal shovel.
#
tc.research_name.ELEMENTALHOE=§7Hoe of Growth
tc.research_text.ELEMENTALHOE=§7Balance of Nature
tc.research_page.ELEMENTALHOE.1=§7By merging the magical energy from order and entropy shards with a thaumium hoe, you have created a farming implement with few equals.<BR>When used to till fields, it will till a 3x3 area instead of just a single block.<BR>When used to crops or other plants it will act as bonemeal to promote its growth, though at a higher cost to its durability. It might even be able to grow plants that normal bonemeal can't.<BR>If shift is held while using this tool all its special properties are suspended and it functions like a normal hoe.

tc.research_text.GOLEMBELL=§7Pay Attention
tc.research_page.GOLEMBELL.1=§7Golems are notoriously bad at following verbal commands, but this bell allows you to avoid all that.<BR>Simply right click on a golem to select it. Once that is done a glowing, gearlike circle will appear indicating the golems 'home' location and the side it is attached to.<BR> You are now able to right click anywhere in the world to link the golem to blocks, locations or inventories it may interact with. Clicking on the same location will either unmark it, or cycle through different colors if the golem is able to interact with different colored markers.
tc.research_page.GOLEMBELL.2=§7<BR>Shift + right-clicking on a marked location will always clear it and pressing F will clear all marked locations.<LINE>Left-clicking on a golem picks it up with all its current upgrades and settings intact. Shift + left-clicking picks up the golem, but removes its core and any attached upgrades which drops separately. There is a good chance that upgrades will be lost if you do this however.

tc.research_text.COREGATHER=§7Picking up what you are putting down
tc.research_page.COREGATHER.1=§7Golem Animations cores are used to give your golems purpose - without a core they remain inanimate.<BR>The first such core you are able to create is the §5Gather§0 core.<BR>Golems fitted with this core will seek dropped items within 16 blocks, pick them up and then place them inside an attached inventory. If they are not attached to an inventory they will simply hold on to them.<BR>If you right click on the golem you will be able to set specific items they should pick up - all others will be ignored.

tc.research_page.COREHARVEST.1=§7Golems fitted with this core need not be attached to an inventory. They seek out fully grown crops, reeds and other commonly farmed plants within a small radius and harvests them. The harvested material simply drops to the ground and must be gathered by some other means.<BR>Unfortunately they are not smart enough to replant the crops they have harvested, but you are sure with a bit of work you might be able to eventually fix that bug.

tc.research_page.DISTILESSENTIA.1=§7You see a future need where you will need ready access to multiple different kinds of aspects - not just primal aspects drawn from your wand.<BR>Using basic alchemical principles you have divised a way to break down objects and convert them into essentia.<BR>The first step in this process requires an §lAlchemical Furnace§r. The alchemical furnace works much like a normal furnace by burning coal to produce heat, but instead of smelting ore into metal, it breaks down objects into a slurry of raw, unprocessed essentia.
tc.research_page.DISTILESSENTIA.2=§7The next step in the process is to take the essentia slurry and distill it using an §lArcane Alembic§r.<BR>To work, arcane alembics need to be placed on top of an alchemy furnace. The essentia slurry will slowly be drawn into the alembic and the indivual aspected essentia separated out.<BR>If the alchemical furnace is being powered by alumentum, this distillation process is much faster.<BR>You can stack up to 5 different alembics on top if a single furnace.<BR>The essentia can then be extracted out of an alembic using phials.

The enchantments placed on the jars also makes adding or extracting essentia a breeze.<BR>Jars placed under the spout of an alembic will be automatically filled. They can also be filled and emptied using phials.<BR>What is more they make an excellent storage medium for jams and preserves.
tc.research_page.JARLABEL.2=§7Shift clicking on jars and alembics with an empty hand will empty them.<BR>As long as a jar contains some essentia, you can attach a §lJar Label§r to it.<BR>This label will 'lock' the jar to that type of essentia and it will not be able to accept any other kind of essentia.<BR>You can remove a label by shift clicking with an empty hand on the side of the jar containing the label. Take care not to shift click on any other side as it will empty the jar as normal.
tc.research_page.JARLABEL.3=§7You can place a label in a crafting bench with a phial of essentia to assign an aspect to it and when placed on an empty jar it will automatically lock the jar to that aspect. The essentia used in the recipe is not consumed.<BR>Placing it on a filled jar will change the label to the jar's essentia type.<LINE>A label can be made blank again by simply placing it by itself in a crafting grid.

tc.research_name.INFERNALFURNACE=§7Infernal Furnace
tc.research_text.INFERNALFURNACE=§7Hot enough?
tc.research_page.INFERNALFURNACE.1=§7By harnessing raw §cIgnis§0 within a furnace crafted from obsidian and netherbrick you have created a highly efficient and fuel free furnace. So efficient in fact, that occasionally it will produce bonus materials in the form of nuggets or other items.<BR>While this is essentially free, it is also very slow unless the furnace gets a new supply of §cIgnis§0 essentia every now and again. This can be done by placing a jar of §cIgnis§0 essentia within line of sight of the front of the furnace, somewhere within 10 blocks. Luckily a little essentia goes a long way.
tc.research_page.INFERNALFURNACE.2=§7It should also be noted that the occasional bit of Flux escapes into the environment.<BR>Items you wish to smelt needs to be dropped into the top of the furnace and will be spit out the front.

tc.research_text.BELLOWS=§7Stoking the flames
tc.research_page.BELLOWS.1=§7The Arcane Bellows performs much the same function as its mundane counterpart, the only difference is that it happily pumps away by itself sending forth a stream of neverending air.<BR>Attaching it to an Infernal Furnace has shown some interesting results. The elemental infused air not only stokes the flames increasing its smelting speed, but causes them to burn much purer, resulting in a reduction of flux generated and increasing the chance of creating bonus nuggets and other materials when smelting.
tc.research_page.BELLOWS.2=§7They can also be attached to normal or alchemical furnaces to increase their speed.<BR>It is also possible to attach them to crucibles to reduce the time it takes for their water to boil.<BR>Bellows can be deactivated by applying a redstone signal.<BR>You are confident more uses will reveal themselves eventually.

tc.research_name.INFUSION=§7Infusion
tc.research_text.INFUSION=§7Mystical fusion
tc.research_page.INFUSION.1=§7Arcane crafting and alchemy can go only so far. Something better is needed to create truly powerful mystical objects.<BR>Infusion crafting is the process of infusing a single object with magical energy and the properties of other objects. You could, for example, infuse a stone with §6Aer§0 vis and a feather and it would result in a very light stone.<BR>As is usual with thaumaturgy, things are not quite that simple. To even get started with infusion crafting there are several things you need: A Runic Matrix, arcane pedestals and a ready supply of magic in the form of essentia.
tc.research_page.INFUSION.2=§7Once you have your Runic Matrix properly placed into a structure commonly known as an Infusion Altar, you can begin to craft.<BR>The central pedestal located under the matrix is where the item you wish to infuse will go. You will also need several more pedestals placed around the altar where you can place the blocks and items you wish to infuse into the target object. Lastly you will need warded jars or similar essentia containers holding the requisite amount of vis.<BR>Once all this is gathered you can click on the Runic Matrix with a wand to start the crafting process.<BR>During the first stage of crafting essentia will be drained
tc.research_page.INFUSION.3=§7from nearby sources. Crafting will stall of there is insufficient essentia available - something that you do not want as will be explained on following pages.<BR>Once all the required essentia has been infused into the target object, the other objects will have their essential essence drained. Only when this is done will the crafting process complete.<LINE>Infusion crafting is not without risks. The entire process involves forcing vast energies into a single object. Unpredictable things tend to happen.<BR>Usually one of the fusion objects get
tc.research_page.INFUSION.4=§7knocked off a pedestal, or flux gets generated, but more catastrophic events are not unheard of.<BR>The longer crafting continues due to unresolved problems like lack of vis or dropped items, the greater the chance of something bad happening.<BR>These effects can be reduced by various means. Firstly you wish to keep the entire fusion structure as symmetrical as possible - take careful note of where you place pedestals and make sure they are balanced with other pedestals on the opposite side of the altar. When placing fusion items into them you may wish to keep them balanced as well. Lastly you can place occult paraphernalia around the
tc.research_page.INFUSION.5=§7altar in symmetrical formations (things like candles, skulls, crystals, etc.). These will have the effect of reducing instability.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research5.png:128:0:128:136:1</IMG>

tc.research_text.HOVERHARNESS=§7Is it a bird...
tc.research_page.HOVERHARNESS.1=§7You have finally managed to unlock the secret of flight. You have created a harness that anchors itself to the Thaumic Field using thaumostatic energy allowing you to defy gravity. You think quantum's and quarks might also be involved somehow.<BR>Unusually the only vis required to power this harness is added during its creation process. Instead the fuel it requires for flight is raw Potentia. Simply right click while holding the harness to insert filled jars.<BR>Pressing 'F' while wearing the harness activates or deactivates it.
tc.research_page.HOVERHARNESS.2=§7While active the harness will constantly use Potentia.<BR>It can be enchanted with the Haste enchant to increase the speed at which you move while flying.

tc.research_text.ADVANCEDGOLEM=§7Maybe I should think this through...
tc.research_page.ADVANCEDGOLEM.1=§7You have discovered a way of improving golems in several minor, but significant ways.<BR>Firstly, golems that go through this process are able to hold one additional upgrade, though they can never have more than two upgrades of a single type.<BR>Secondly, they move slightly faster.<BR>Thirdly, they have a slightly greater sight radius.<BR>You are sure the malevolant intent in their eyes is just your imagination.
#
tc.research_name.ARCANEBORE=§7Arcane Bore
tc.research_text.ARCANEBORE=§7Mining evolved
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.1=§7You have discovered a device capable of extending the range and power of an Excavation focus. Of even greater use is the fact that the machine can do so without your constant supervision. You merely need to place it on a specially constructed base, point it in the right direction with a wand and apply a redstone signal.<BR>The arcane bore requires two things to function. The first is an excavation focus placed in its leftmost inventory slot. Any enchantments applied to the focus will also alter the functions of the bore.
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.2=§7Secondly you need to place any kind of pickaxe into the rightmost slot. The material of the pickaxe will have little effect on the operation of the bore, but the greater its durability, the longer it will last. Like the wand, any enchantments or special abilities of the pickaxe will also be applied to whatever the bore mines.<BR>Placing a jar of §8Perditio§0 essentia near the bore (within 8 blocks) will greatly speed up the rate at which it mines, but will consume 1 point of §8Perditio§0 for every 16 blocks mined.<BR>An arcane bore can only be placed above or below an arcane bore base. Any items mined will be ejected from the base in the direction its nozzle is pointing.
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.3=§7It will eject into an inventory if possible. This direction can be changed with a wand.

tc.research_page.LEVITATOR.1=§7While not true flight, the Arcane Levitator is the next best thing.<BR>When placed the levitator lifts any item or creature above it up to 10 blocks into the air. A sneaking creature or player will be slowly lowered.<BR>Each levitator placed upon another increases the range at which it can lift entities by 10 blocks, so a stack of 3 can lift entities up to 30 blocks.<BR>Levitators can be deactivated by applying a redstone signal to them.

tc.research_page.ARCANEEAR.1=§7The Arcane Ear is a device that is capable of detecting the sound emitted from nearby note blocks. If it hears a note it recognizes it will emit a short redstone pulse.<BR>The Arcane Ear needs to be tuned in a manner identical to note blocks, the tone and note it listens for depends on the material it is placed upon.
#
tc.research_name.MIRROR=§7Mirror Magic
tc.research_text.MIRROR=§7Through the looking glass
tc.research_page.MIRROR.1=§7You are now able to enchant a pair of magical mirrors that act as doorways to the void between the worlds. Anything shoved through the one mirror will pass through this realm and exit through the other mirror - even across dimensional bounderies.<BR>Unfortunately this realm is extremely hostile to mortal creatures like yourself so using these mirrors to transport living creatures is not yet possible.<BR>To link a pair of these magical mirrors you simply need to place one of them in a desired location. You then right-click with a second
tc.research_page.MIRROR.2=§7mirror on the one you placed, and the pair will become linked. You may then place the second wherever you wish and items thrown into one will be ejected out the other.<BR>Mirrors can only be linked in pairs, so while both are placed in the world and able to transmit items you cannot link them to another mirror. When you pick up a mirror it will remember the last partner it was linked with, allowing you to easily move it without having to relink it. However while one of the paired mirrors is picked up, you may easily relink either of them.<BR>Tranporting items is not free. You require a source of Iter nearby and each full stack of items will drain 1 essentia.

tc.research_text.MIRRORHAND=§7Personal reflection
tc.research_page.MIRRORHAND.1=§7This magical hand mirror functions much the same way as other magical mirrors. You simply push items through the glass and they will pop out at the linked mirror.<BR>Simple right-click while holding the linked hand mirror and you will be able to place any items in your inventory into the looking glass to have them transported.<BR>The hand mirror can be linked to a mirror that is already paired with another.<BR>It should be noted that the hand mirror can only send items, not recieve them.

tc.research_text.NODEJAR=§7For the Thaumaturgist on the go
tc.research_page.NODEJAR.1=§7Warded jars have proven themselves capable of storing all manner of mundane and mystical things, and you believe you have discovered another use for them - trapping aura nodes.<BR>By constructing a large version of a jar around a node and enacting the proper mystical formula with your wand, the node will become trapped inside the construct which will quickly shrink to a more manageable size. The jar can then be safely picked up and moved around, but the initial trapping spell does have a very good chance of damageing the node.<BR>While trapped the node is kept suspended and will not regenerate vis, nor can vis be drawn from it.
tc.research_page.NODEJAR.2=§7It is possible to free the node from the jar by placing it in the world and clicking on it with a wand. The jar will be destroyed in the process.

tc.research_page.PAVEWARD.1=§7You have discovered a way of turning arcane stone blocks into mystical wards that will prevent most creatures from crossing them.<BR>It should be noted that these wards aren't always 100% foolproof and they cannot prevent other players from entering an area, but they keep most of common threats at bay. They will also prevent golems from crossing them.<BR>For best results you need an unbroken line of them between the area you wish to protect and the outside world.<BR>An active redstone signal will disable this block.

Until now.<BR>This focus can be placed on top of a wand recharge pedestal which will allow any wand it contains to siphon off the compound vis from nearby nodes. Unfortunately each point of compound vis is broken down into a single point of primal vis and all the excess energy is lost. However it is a good start and you are sure you will discover better ways to access this resource.

You have found a way to awaken these properties and turn it into an Ethereal Bloom.<BR>Ethereal blooms slowly, but surely, restores land corrupted by mystical means to its former glory - this includes the blight known as Taint. While it cannot combat Taint directly, few tainted growths can survive outside their native environment for long and tend to die back.

tc.research_text.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT=§7Enchanting with Essentia
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.1=§7For ages now wizards and thaumaturges have been enchanting weapons, tools and armor by imbueing objects with their own life energy. While effective the process is tedious and the results are completely unpredictable. Your discovery of infusion crafting might have uncovered a solution to both those problems.<BR>You have discovered a way to enchant objects with an infusion altar. Simply place the item you wish to enchant on the central pedestal and supply the proper ingredients and essentia.
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.2=§7It also requires some life essence in the form of experience, but much less than would be normally required to enchant something. This experience is drawn from anyone near the infusion altar so care should be taken.<BR>The essentia and experience costs listed in following recipes are for the first level of enchantment. To enchant an item to higher levels, simply perform the infusion process again - it can be repeated till the required enchantment has reached its maximum possible level. Essentia and experience cost are multiplied by the level of enchantment you are performing, so a level II enchant costs twice as much as a level I.
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.3=§7Additional costs might is also required if the item already contains enchants other than the one you are currently performing. This cost is usually around 10% per level of enchantment. So enchanting a sword with Fire Aspect I that alread contains Smite III will cost 30% more.<BR>Instability also increases as the total number of enchantments on the object increases.<BR>Enchanting items with an infusion altar follows the normal rules for enchantment as it applies to what enchants can combine with others.

tc.research_name.TUBES=§7Essentia Tubes
tc.research_text.TUBES=§7Transportation of essentia
tc.research_page.TUBES.1=§7You have discovered several ways to transport essentia, but none of them has proven useful for large scale alchemical operations - until now.<BR>You have unlocked the key to creating stable and relatively leak-free tubing. While mundane chemicals can be transported in glass, certain types of essentia either disolves or simply passes right through it. By wrapping the glass in iron and treating it with quicksilver you have managed to protect it from even the most volatile types of essentia. Gold fittings finish off the piping system and makes it visually appealing.
tc.research_page.TUBES.2=§7The tubes can be connected to all manner of alchemical devices, though warded jars and alembics are their primary targets.<BR>Essentia flows through the tubes whenever something is connected to them that can accept it, like warded jars.<BR>Jars containing different kinds of essentia will only draw their kind of essentia towards them. Tubes however can only draw and transport one kind of essentia at a time - the highest drawing strength will take priority. Without the proper use of valves it is quite easy for a network of tubes to get gummed up. The use of valves is essential.<BR>When you see gasses being vented
tc.research_page.TUBES.3=§7from a tube, it means different kinds of suction are interfering with each other. The color gives a clue as to the types of suction.<LINE>The essentia valve acts much like a normal length of tubing, except it can be turned off by hand or a redstone signal. When this is done the flow off essentia through it will be cut off.<LINE>The Essentia Resonator is handy for troubleshooting your tube network. You can use it on a tube or other essentia using device to see what essentia it currently contains and the suction it is applying.

tc.research_name.CENTRIFUGE=§7Alchemical Centrifuge
tc.research_text.CENTRIFUGE=§7Taking things apart
tc.research_page.CENTRIFUGE.1=§7The alchemical centrifuge is a wonderous invention that allows you to break essentia into its component parts.<BR>When compound essentia flows into the centrifuge from below it will be slowly broken down into the primal or compound essentia that it is made from. Only one of the components is created for each point of essentia broken down.<BR>The resulting essentia needs to be drawn from the top of the centrifuge. Because of the idiosyncrasies of the tube pressure system, it would be best to connect a §5Essentia Buffer§0 to the top of the centrifuge (see next page).
tc.research_page.CENTRIFUGE.2=§7The essentia buffer allows you to store a limited amount of essentia - 8 points total, though it can be made up of any combination of essentia types. Like a jar it has suction, though it applies the minimum amount of suction possible (1).<BR>This means that is usually only able to draw essentia from an essentia source it is directly attached to. However tubes can be connect to all its sides, meaning that it is invaluable for getting essentia out of devices like the centrifuges that could contain variable types of essentia.<BR>You can attach bellows to the buffer - each attached bellows increases its suction by 32.

It will drop all items in its inventory of you do so. Shift-clicking will also cause it to drop any upgrades you have applied to it with the normal loss chance.<BR>It can accept a single upgrade like normal golems, but they grant unique abilities to the trunk.

tc.research_page.MIRRORESSENTIA.1=§7Magical mirrors are very useful for transporting items over long distances, but what if that same principle can be applied to essentia? You think you have discovered a way to do just that.<BR>Essentia mirrors, like their name implies, can transport essentia in the same way that magic mirrors transport items. There are a few important limitations however.<BR>You cannot pipe essentia directly into the mirrors - they are only able to transport essentia that has been drawn from a source towards something like an Infusion Matrix or Arcane Furnace.
tc.research_page.MIRRORESSENTIA.2=§7In effect the mirrors allow these things to draw essentia from sources via the mirror.<BR>Drawing something as unstable as essentia over such long distances has some risks and occasionaly a small amount of essentia will get lost.

This is finally a thing of the past.<BR>The Thaumatorium is a marvellous invention that allows a thaumaturge to select which formula to use and what catalysts to add. It then automatically draws essentia from available sources using tubes.

tc.research_page.RUNICARMOR.1=§7Your research into protective magics have led you to discover Runic Armor. The name is misleading though since it is not armor in the traditional sense, but a collection of charms, seals and similar protective devices worn with your everyday clothes.<BR>These devices create a barrier of magical energy that wards out most types of damage. The armor has a pool of hit points from which damage is subtracted first, protecting the wearer from all harm. Once this pool is depleted the wearer starts taking damage as normal.
tc.research_page.RUNICARMOR.2=§7The pool replenishes over time, but even when depleted the armor offers protection roughly equivalent to that of leather armor.<BR>The armor requires §2Terra§0 and §eAer§0 vis to replenish its charge which it draws from carried wands.<BR>The armor offers no protection from damage suffered due to drowning, starvation or similar environmental hazards.<BR>Due to its nature the armor cannot be enchanted by normal means, but you are sure there are ways to improve its effectiveness - you just need to discover them.

Additionally the door will refuse to open for anyone but its owner. The owner can also craft iron or gold keys that will grant others access to this door.<BR>By crafting an iron key and clicking on the door, you will link the key to that door.
tc.research_page.WARDEDARCANA.2=§7You can then give the key to another person and they will be able to use it on the door to gain permanent permission to open it. They will still not be able to break the door, or grant anyone else access.
