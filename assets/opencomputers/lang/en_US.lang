oc:tooltip.UpgradeGenerator=§7Can be used to generate energy from fuel on the go. Burns items to generate energy over time, based on their fuel value.[nl] §fEfficiency§7: §a%s%%§7
oc:tooltip.UpgradeHover=§7This upgrade allows robots to fly higher above the ground without having to climb walls.[nl] Maximum height: §f%s§7

oc:tooltip.UpgradeMF.Unlinked=§7§fNo connection§7
oc:tooltip.UpgradeLeash=§7Allows some devices, such as drones, to bind Isaa- excuse me... *chatter* My apologies. I'm just being told this is actually used to put animals on a leash. Multiple animals, even. Odd.
oc:tooltip.UpgradeNavigation=§7Can be used to determine the position and orientation of a device. The position is relative to the center of the map that was used to craft this upgrade.
oc:tooltip.UpgradePiston=§7This upgrade is very pushy. It allows moving blocks, similar to when using a piston. It does §lnot§7 move entities, however.
oc:tooltip.UpgradeSign=§7Allows reading text on and writing text to signs.
oc:tooltip.UpgradeSolarGenerator=§7Can be used to generate energy from sunlight on the go. Requires a clear line of sight to the sky above the device. Generates energy at %s%% of the speed of a Stirling Engine.
oc:tooltip.UpgradeTank=§7This upgrade provides a tank for fluid storage for robots and drones. Without one of these, they will not be able to store fluids internally.
oc:tooltip.UpgradeTankController=§7This upgrade allows robots and drones more control in how they interacts with external tanks, and allows them to transfer fluids into and out of fluid tank items in their inventory.
oc:tooltip.UpgradeTractorBeam=§7Equips a device with extremely advanced technology, nicknamed the "Item Magnet". Allows the device to pick up items anywhere within 3 blocks of its location.
oc:tooltip.UpgradeTrading=§7Allows robots and drones to trade with villagers.
oc:tooltip.Waypoint=§7Provides a point of reference to devices with a navigation upgrade.
oc:tooltip.WirelessNetworkCard=§7Allows wireless sending of network messages in addition to normal ones. You can adjust the §fsignal strength§7 to control how far messages are sent. Higher signal strength results in higher energy consumption.
oc:tooltip.WorldSensorCard=§7Allows reading out information about the world, such as its gravity and whether it has a breathable atmosphere. Use results at own risk. The manufacturer takes no responsibility for bodily or material harm caused by decisions made upon the cards' outputs. We have lawyers. And money. Don't even try.
oc:tooltip.Wrench=§7A hybrid of Screwdriver and Wrench, this tool is easy to learn, but hard to master.
oc:tooltip.UpgradeRITEG=§7Pocket nuke for your microcontrollers and tablets. Generates energy at %s%% of the speed of a Stirling Engine.
