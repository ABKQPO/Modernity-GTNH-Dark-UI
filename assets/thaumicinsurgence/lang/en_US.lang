InfusionIntercepter.1=§7Finally, after all of this time... <BR><BR>You finally did it...<BR><BR>After years of hard work and a pact with that damnable [Entity]... <BR><BR>You finally did it...<BR><BR>You infused your very [Soul] into this block...<BR><BR>You don't know why, but you placed it under the central pedestal and attached your tubes to the bottom of this block and by the eldritch it [W0RKED!!]<BR><BR>He said he'd make you a [BIG SHOT], but what happens now?

SoapAlpha.1=§7It concerned you that your thaumically perfected soap can't even guarantee relief from your personal demons. But with a little trickery, you were able to push it the extra mile! <BR><BR>You wonder if there's any way you can push further...
SoapBeta.1=§7After some thought on your previous attempt at improving your soap, you began to believe there was some room for improvement... <BR><BR>You've been able to rid yourself of the stickier tears in your mind, but yet, you could still feel the tangible rips in your soul as their effects coursed through your mind, yet you weren't able to rid yourself of them...<BR>Until now. <BR>While you quickly figured out that it was impossible to directly remove them, by happenstance you found success in transmogrification.
SoapBeta.2=§7Albeit with a few caveats...<BR><BR>The baseline success rate is extremely low and failure is taxing on the primitive portions of your mind.<BR><BR>The cost of this transmogrification, however, is that for every hole within your soul, twice the number of tears rip open within your mind.<BR><BR>Yet you feel as if there was yet still some way you could improve this further...


ThaumicInterfacer.1=§7I'm not sure where I found this design. It looks like an early attempt at making or modifying a thaumometer, hence my working name for it. The device seems to show something, but not what a properly made one does.                             It seems like the work of someone tinkering with infusion, given its method of creation and its reaction to runic matrices. Probably just a curiosity, for the average thaumaturge not tinkering with the innate fundamentals of infusion.                             This likely won't help you on your journey young thaumaturge.
